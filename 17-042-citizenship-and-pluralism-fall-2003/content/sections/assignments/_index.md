Paper Assignments
-----------------

Two papers are required in the course.

Both papers are 8-10 pages and are due five days after lecture 8 and two days after lecture 14. It is worth 40% of the grade. Topics are distributed in class and may be downloaded: paper 1 topics ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/paper_topics_paper_1)); paper 2 topics ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/paper_topics_paper_2)).

Instead of writing two papers, students have the option of writing one long paper on a topic of their own choosing. This paper will count for 80% of the course grade. Those choosing this option must submit a one-page proposal for a paper latest, five days after lecture 8. This paper will be due two days after lecture 14.
